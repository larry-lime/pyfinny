## General Notes
* This seems kind of boring and kind of really easy
* Steps to follow
  1. Select an appropriate set of comparable public companies
    - Criteria: Geography, industry, and financial "size"
    - Target: Ideally, you choose 5-10 companies in the set; ~50 is too much ,and 1-2 is too little
  2. Determine the metrics and multiples that you want to use
  3. Calculate he metrics and multiples for all companies
  4. Apply the median and/or 25/57th percentile multiples from the set to your company to estimate its implied Equity value and Enterprise value

## Limitations
* I don't know where to get preferred stock
* I don't have a resource to get LTM
* I don't have an endpoint for diluted shares
